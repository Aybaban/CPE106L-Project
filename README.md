Windows: How to Check or Get Python

In this section, you’ll learn to check whether Python is installed on your Windows operating system (OS) and which version you have. You’ll also explore three installation options that you can use on Windows.


Checking the Python Version on Windows
To check whether you already have Python on your Windows machine, open a command-line application like PowerShell or the Windows Terminal.

Follow the steps below to open PowerShell on Windows:

Press the Win key.
Type PowerShell.
Press Enter.

Linux: How to Check or Get Python

In this section, you’ll learn how to check which version of Python, if any, is on your Linux computer. You’ll also learn about the installation options to get the latest Python on Linux systems.

Checking the Python Version on Linux
Most Linux distributions come with Python installed by default. In most cases, the installed version won’t be the latest Python. To find out which version of Python you have on Linux, open a terminal window and run the following command:

$ python3 --version
If you have Python on your machine, then this command will respond with a version number. Instead of --version, you can use the shorter -V switch:

$ python3 -V
Either of these switches will give you the version number of the Python installation that the command is associated with. If your current version is outdated, you’ll want to get the latest version of Python.
